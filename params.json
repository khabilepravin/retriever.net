  "body": "### Welcome to Retriever.net\r\nIn most .net projects some way of accessing database data is required, usually for all new projects many may choose to use ORM frameworks. But at times you just need an easy way to access data without much configuration. With many modern apps and APIs, all you need is JSON as input and output. \r\n\r\nThis library makes it easy to develop JSON based data access layer without much ADO.net boilerplate code. \r\nCurrently only works with MS SQL Server database.  \r\n\r\nThis library depends heavily on [Newtonsoft.Json](http://www.newtonsoft.com/json) \r\n\r\nYou can do retrieve directly to JSON with couple of lines of code like...  \r\n\r\n    // Param is the db connection string \r\n    SqlDataRequest dataRequest = new SqlDataRequest(\"[ConnectionString]\");    \r\n    string result = dataRequest.Fetch(\"[dbo].[usp_Test_Select]\", \"{ Id : 1 }\"));  \r\n\r\nSimilarly an insert/update is as simple as... \r\n\r\n    var obj = new\r\n    {\r\n     Id = rInt,\r\n     Name = \"John Doe\",\r\n     Description = \"Demo test description\"\r\n    };\r\n               \r\n    int rowsAffected = dataRequest.Hurl(\"[dbo].[usp_Test_Insert]\", obj);",
