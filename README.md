In most .net projects you need some way of accessing database data, usually for all new projects many may choose to use ORM frameworks. But at times you just need an easy way to access data without much configuration. With many modern apps, all you need is JSON coming out and going in.

This library is an attempt to make it super easy have JSON based dataaccess layer in minutes on SQL Server database(target is to support all major databases in future).
